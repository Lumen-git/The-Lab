Since some parts of The Lab are created by Lumen (Aidan Moran) and some are pulled from various other creators, no part of The Lab may be reused without permission from the creator (Aidan Moran, aimorandev@gmail.com). If the part of the WAD in question is original, you will likely be given permission, otherwise you will be given information to the original work and must follow permissions/crediting information there. If you use parts/techniques from The Lab, you must give credit to Aidan "Lumen" Moran, https://lumen-git.github.io/.
